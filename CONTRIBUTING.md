### Code Contributions

If you have the capacity to write code, and wish to contribute to
Streetmix, we'd love your help! 

**A request:** before you write any new feature or code, please [open an
issue][], or comment on the issue you'd like to work on. That way the
maintainers of the project can guide your work from the outset, making
it more likely that we'll be able to accept your work when it's ready. 

In general, you can help by:
* Writing or editing documentation

  inconsistent whitespace)
* Refactoring code
* Closing [issues][]
* Reviewing patches

Once your code is ready, please push your work to a feature branch on
your fork of the Streetmix repo, and submit a pull request to us.
